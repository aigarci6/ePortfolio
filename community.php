            <h2>Cadet Leadership Course (CLC)</h2>
            CLC is a week long event in collaberation between the High School Air Force Junior ROTC units of the greater houston area and the University of Houston's Air Force ROTC program. The college cadets act as the Cadet <b>Training Officers</b> (CTOs) of the junior cadets, <b>developing</b> the junior cadets through the application of:
            <ul>
                <li>Mentorship</li>
                <li>Controlled stress application</li>
                <li>Discipline</li>
                <li>Leading by example</li>
            </ul>
            It is a very long and tiring event with little sleep where we get the amazing opportunity to shape our nations children into confident and capable citizens, as well as recieve mentorship from high ranking retired military members with vast knowledge. As of November 2022, I have served in 4 CLCs, including being the Chief CTO of one as shown in my <a href="professional.php">Professional Page</a>.
