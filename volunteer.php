        Giving back to the community is something very important to me, particularly in things that help create the future generations.
        One day we will be gone, but the community will go on. I hope to do all that I can so that that community has all it needs to prosper. <br><br>

            <h2>Cadet Leadership Course (CLC)</h2>
            CLC is a week long event in collaboration between the High School Air Force Junior ROTC units of the Greater Houston Area and the University of Houston's Air Force ROTC program. The college cadets act as the Cadet <b>Training Officers</b> (CTOs) of the junior cadets, <b>developing</b> the junior cadets through the application of:
            <ul>
                <li>Mentorship</li>
                <li>Controlled stress application</li>
                <li>Discipline</li>
                <li>Leading by example</li>
            </ul>
            It is a very long and tiring event with little sleep where we get the amazing opportunity to shape our nations children into confident and capable citizens, as well as recieve mentorship from high ranking retired military members with vast knowledge. As of November 2022, I have served in 4 CLCs, including being the Chief CTO of one as shown in my <a href="professional.php#airForce">Professional</a> Page. No other volunteer event I have done is as intense or fulfilling as completing a CLC as a CTO.

            <h2>Recruiting</h2>
            I decided to join the military due to a national guard recruiter coming to speak to us at my high school Junior ROTC unit. I hope to provide current high schoolers with that same opportunity of learning what options are out there and inspire them to always strive to do more with the cards they have been dealt.
