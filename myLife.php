    <h2>My Life</h2>
    Being born and raised in Houston, Tx, I have not had the opportunity to see the world like others have, but I am grateful for the life I have been able to experience in my town of Houston, one of the
    biggest and most diverse cities in the nation and the world. The following gallery shows images of my life through time, displaying the opportunities I have been able to experience and the growth I have had as time goes on.
    <br><br>I hope to continue having the opportunity to serve my community and grow as a person, always striving for <b>humility</b> in all my thoughts, <b>approachability</b> in my personality, and <b>credibility</b> in my actions and words.
