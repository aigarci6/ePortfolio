            <h2>Chief Cadet Training Officer<br>(Chief CTO)</h2>
            Served as Chief CTO, leading a team of 15 fellow CTOs in running a weeklong basic training-like camp for over 300 high schoolers. <br>
            Goal of the camp is to <b>develop</b> the <b>teamwork and leadership</b> capabilities of the Junior Cadets. <br><br>
            As Chief CTO, I developed multi-faceted leadership, having to balance:
            <ul>
                <li>Directions from the instructors (the people overseeing the camp)</li>
                <li>Leading my fellow CTOs and delivering instructions to them from the instructors, giving them guidance on my vision for the camp, and elevating their feedback and complaints up to the instructors</li>
                <li>Developing the junior cadets under me, making sure to keep a balance of strictness and personableness</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Air Force Academy Free Fall<br>(AFAFF)</h2>
            I was 1 of 50 AFROTC cadets chosen nationwide to attend AFAFF, a program where we jump out of a plane 5 times to earn our military wings. <br><br>
            The cirriculum was composed of 1 week of intense training, practice, and evaluation, followed by the second week being composed of the actual jumps. The program is one of, if not the only, programs where your first jump is completely solo.
