                <h2>Chief Cadet Training Officer<br>(Chief CTO) - Summer 2022</h2>
                Served as Chief CTO, leading a team of 15 fellow CTOs in running a weeklong basic training-like camp for over 300 high schoolers. <br>
                Goal of the camp is to <b>develop</b> the <b>teamwork and leadership</b> capabilities of the Junior Cadets. <br><br>
                As Chief CTO, I developed multi-faceted leadership, having to balance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Directions from the instructors (the people overseeing the camp)</li>
                    <li>Leading my fellow CTOs and delivering instructions to them from the instructors, giving them guidance on my vision for the camp, and elevating their feedback and complaints up to the instructors</li>
                    <li>Developing the junior cadets under me, making sure to keep a balance of strictness and personableness</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="variableDiv">
        <span class="reveal reveallevel" style="width: 80%; text-align:center">
            I had done 3 Cadet Leadership Courses prior to the one in 2022. This one was the first where I was the one given the role of Chief CTO, placing me responsible for all that me and my fellow CTO's were in charge of doing. Not only was this the first CLC that I would be leading, but it was the first full CLC in over 2 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone was coming into the situation anxious and excited to do something very complex that had not been done in a very long time.
            <br><br>I knew how tired everyone would get. We typically get around 4 hours of sleep every night for a week straight. My job was to not only make sure that the high school cadets recieved exceptional training, but that my CTO's were aware of their expectations and maintained their health, both physical and emotional. Building upon my experience as the Cadet Group Commander, I knew it was vital that I be a strong liason between the instructors and my CTO's. Also important was making sure that work was spread out evenly and no one felt that they were doing more work than others as tensions were already high due to everyone being tired. <br><br id="cog">
            I was very blessed to have a dedicated team that understood the importance of developing the high schoolers into "citizens of character", as the Junior ROTC mission statement conveys. Every CLC I have done has been very special, however this one has been the one that I have cherished most for the experience I gained and the people I was directly in charge of helping.

            The Cadet Operations Group Commander is the highest position that can be given to a member of the Air Force ROTC unit. When I was given this opportunity, I had experience leading at a team level but not at an organizational level. Using the experiences I had learned as a team leader, I knew that I had to set a clear vision and set the pace in the beginning. What I came to learn is that it was no longer about what I could do, but about what I could <b>inspire my team</b> to do. <br><br>
            One of the first lessons I learned was that of <b>consistency</b>. My job as the commander was to focus my unit on what is important and a very easy way to do that is by getting everyone into a strong routine. <br><br>
            Another lesson was in <b>fairness</b>. We are a military organization comprised of students, meaning everyone is extremely busy. In my time in AFROTC, I had seen how unevenly work was distributed to certain cadet officers in the unit. To combat this, I set up a mentorship program where every cadet officer in the unit was in charge of 2-3 cadets, eliminating positions where some cadet officers were in charge of over 10 cadets and other in charge of none. This also served to <b>empower</b> my team, making everyone feel that they played a key part in the organization. <br><br>
            My job was not to micro manage but to make everyone in the unit feel like they had <b>purpose</b> and that they were heard by me. I used skills like those earned in my honors leadership minor to make sure that meetings went as smoothly as they could and so that my people were developed to their full potential. 
            <br><br>One very important lesson of teamwork that I learned was that a good plan executed with passion is better than a perfect plan executed poorly. As commander, I was the one making decisions and many times I felt that my plans were better than the ones my team came up with but it was important to give them some control and decision making so that they would be invested in the process, not just doing it because I told them to. <br><br>
            The position is a very complicated one to execute perfectly, especially since everyone in the unit is a student. I tried getting people to participate in workout challenges and promote volunteer events, however participation could not be increased due to having other commitments and objectives to meet. That failure taught me to <b>prioratize</b> what matter most. Another struggle was the fact that I was in charge of the entire team under me, but there were still those in charge of me. All decision I made had to go with the vision they had provided me, and all that my team did I had to be able to answer to them for. Being commander is a very tricky balance and experience that I loved for all that I learned from it and all that I was able to help my unit do. <br><br>
            I will always be grateful for the team I had while I was commander and for the effort they placed into carrying out the mission.

            Field training was an event where I was evaluated for everything that I had been learning for 3 years. The stress applied helped create me, as pressure creates diamonds, into the cadet officer I would become. Using my experiences in prior events, I was able to focus in my time there and learned the importance of helping out my team so that everyone can make it through those 2 weeks of evaluation and growth. Some of my fondest memories of AFROTC took place at field training, and it is an experience I am very proud to have completed.
