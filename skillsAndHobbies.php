            <h2>Photography</h2>
            I enjoy seeing life from an artistic point of view, aiming to capture scenes for their beauty and be able to have a recollection through time of my life using images. 
            I am by no means a professional but I have taken graduation, engangement, and organizational photos and I enjoy the artistic side it lets me express, as well as being able to provide others with images they like of themselves.

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            The piano is a hobby I picked up recently, continuing my musical interest from my time in choir and as Band Captain in high school. My goal is to play in every city I visit. As of November 2022, I have played in Houston, San Antonio, and College Station.
