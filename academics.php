        My academic interests really kicked off when I went to an intership at Baylor St Lukes Hospital in the Texas Medical Center. Being a first generation college student, I did not really have anyone around me that knew anything about college or academia. My high school was also not the best, but when I went to that intership, I was give the amazing opportunity to interact with highly motivated and educated individuals, such as doctors and nurses. That really set me on a path to pursue my academic interests and I have loved the time that I have been at the University of Houston and all that I learned in those short 5 years.
