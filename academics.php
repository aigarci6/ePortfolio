        My academic interests really kicked off when I went to an intership at Baylor St Lukes Hospital in the Texas Medical Center. Being a first generation college student, I did not really have anyone around me that knew anything about college or academia. My high school was also not the best, but when I interned in that emergency room, I was given the amazing opportunity to interact with highly motivated and educated individuals, such as doctors and nurses. That insight transformed me from the kid that did not care about academics to the person I am today, always seeking to learn the truth. It really set me on a path to pursue my academic interests and I have loved the time that I have been at the University of Houston and all that I learned in these short 5 years.

            This minor is more than just education. My time in Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) has been fundamental in the formation of the man I am today. <br><br>
            Throughout my childhood, I never saw the military as an option. My parents are immigrants for Mexico and I have never been around patriotic individuals that prompted me to consider joining the military. Junior year of high school, I enrolled in the Junior ROTC unit at my high school because my friend asked me to. One day a recruiter came and I remember him talking about special operations and how those individuals were so humble that they would take off their clothes and give it to someone if they needed it. That event transformed me from not knowing what to do with my life to finally having a goal. I wanted to be someone like that. Someone that served others. I did my research and found out about the combat rescue career field in the Air Force. I applied for and was awarded a scholarship, something I will always be grateful for since it allowed me to pay for college. As life has gone on, my knowledge of the Air Force and the career fields available to me has expanded and I am now slated to become a Cyber Operations Officer. <br><br>
            Since joining AFROTC, I have grown as an individual in many ways and have created life long relationships that I will always be grateful for. It is through the military that I have developed the confidence I have and the work ethic I have developed. Through the military also will I continue to grow as an individual, a team member, and a leader

            The first time I was introduced to computer science was in a high school course I took that showed us some aspects of programming. Once I got to college, that interest flourished with every course that I took. I have always been fascinated with the concept of how things work and why they do what they do and the more I learn, the more complex the digital systems we as humans have created are. <br><br>
            The courses "Programming and Data Structures" and "Algorithms and Data Structures" have been instrumental in my Computer Science career because they showed me the basis for what is used to create digital capabilities. Getting through those courses showed me the potential I have as a computer scientist by challenging me to think critically of what processes can be made to produce desired results, as well as prompting me to make those processes as efficient as possible in terms of the time and space they take. These courses are what changed my view of the cyber world as a simple operation on a screen, to a whole new world with its own complexities just like the physical world we live in today. <br><br>
            Classes like Database Systems, Introduction to Ubiquitous Computing, and Software Design introduced me to the world of software engineering and the creation of real world products such as website and applications that can be used to serve some function, whether it be workout planner like the app I developed for one course, or a photography website that I was privileged enough to create for a real world client. The concept of being able to create an entire product with no materials required except the ingenuity of your brain and the time you dedicate is somethign I have come to love. I see why so many pursue their dreams of entrepreneurship. Never in history has the potential for creation been so high, nor the barrier for entry so low. Classes like these have shown me the importance and excitement of intellectual property, and applications like social media and microsoft word have shown me how ideas made products can change the world.

            I first noticed the value of leadership in middle school when I became team captain for the school soccer team. I saw how one could serve the team and help the unit achieve much greater heights than unguided individuals ever could. As time has gone on, I have come to love leadership and teamwork more and more, with this minor playing a significant role in what I have learned about leaders and the different forms they can take.
            <br><br>Coming into this leadership minor, I was hoping to gain theoretical insight into leadership that I could pair with the practical experience I was having in Air Force ROTC. From the minor I have gained all of that and more, with each class providing a unique and new perspective.
            <br><br>Leadership Theory and Practice was an especially pivotal course, providing me with a place to interact with others to learn about leadership throughout history, discuss it with others, and develop our own leadership philosophy, expressing it with one <a href="pdfView.php?pdf=documents/HonorsLeadershipPaperGarciaAxit.pdf">final paper</a> that encompassed everything we had learned in the class.

        <h2>Future Endeavors</h2>
            In my time in college, I have learned so much that I do not see myself ever stopping in the search for truth and knowledge. The growth that I have been able to experiene in my short time in college, especially in just my home town of Houston, Texas, shows me that with more time and the more places I visit, I will continue to develop my life. <br><br>
            I aim to enhance my leadership as I will be an officer in the United States Air Force. This will be one through constant experience in my job, as well as through a lot of reading as there is so much experience out there that people have made sure to record. <br><br>
            I also plan to further my computer science knowledge, most likely with a <b>masters</b> in software engineering or in cyber security so that I may become a technical expert in my career field. That techincal knowledge, combined with my leadership, will allow me to direct teams into creating software or using cyber security to meet the strategic objectives of the United States.
