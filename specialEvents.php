            <h2>Ironman 70.3</h2>
            The ironman 70.3, also known as a Half Ironman, is a long distance triathlon event consisting of the follwing events (including my times for completion):

                    <ul>
                        <li>1.2 mile swim</li>
                        <li>56 mile bike ride</li>
                        <li>13.1 mile run</li>

                <div style="width: 25%;">
                (00:47:52) <br>

            While my times are not the greatest, it provided a great challenge as I recieved an injury to my foot recently before completing it and had to get back into an exercise routine very quickly. The long time the event takes gave me the opportunity to strongly reflect, especially in a tired state. I have signed up for the next annual Texas Ironman 70.3 with the goal of improving my time and pushing myself farther than I ever have before.

            <h2>GoRuck Tough Challenge</h2>
            The GoRuck Tough Challenge is a 10-12 hour event composed of physical training and Rucking (hiking with weight). As a team, we each had a backpack that weighed around 40lbs, and we had to carry many sandbags weighing 40-120lbs each. The event I participated in started at 10pm and ended the next day at 10am. 
            Throughout the event, we get extremly tired and a lot of people get very cranky. For me, it was about staying positive, no matter how much my shoulders hurt or how everyone around me was feeling, as well as pacing myself, ensuring I had the energy to keep going the entire event but not relaxing too much that 
            I was not helping my team with all the weight.
