            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            I am a learner, a follower, a team member, a leader. I am a first generation college student and the son of Immigrant parents, and I seek to continue advancing the success my family has had to get me to where I am. My two focuses are in <b>leadership</b> and <b>computer technologies</b>. <br><br>
            As a striving leader, my goal is to create a cohesive unit in any activity/organization that I may find myself in. I do this by employing the leadership experiences I have had, emotional intelligence, patience, and focusing on serving others. <br><br>
            As a computer scientist, my goal is to maximize the capabilites that technology has to offer. My interests include software engineering to create products with purpose, artifical intelligence to automate tasks and enhance productivity, and cyber sercurity to make sure we are safe in the digital age.

    <h2>My Life</h2>
    Being born and raised in Houston, Tx, I have not had the opportunity to see the world like others have, but I am grateful for the life I have been able to experience in my town of Houston, one of the
    biggest and most diverse cities in the nation and the world. The following gallery shows images of my life through time, displaying the opportunities I have had and my growth as time has gone on.
    <br><br>I hope to continue having the opportunity to serve my community and grow as a person, always striving for <b>humility</b> in all my thoughts, <b>approachability</b> in my personality, and <b>credibility</b> in my actions and words.

            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <b>Towards others:</b> Everything you do, do with love. Serve others for their benefit and to improve the situation that they may find themselves in. <br><br>
            <b>Towards myself:</b> Practice virtue in all things. Try your best to not let negative situations affect you, but embrace positive situations for how great they are.

            <h2>Photography</h2>
            I enjoy seeing life from an artistic point of view, aiming to capture scenes for their beauty and be able to have a recollection through time of my life using images.
            I am by no means a professional but I have taken graduation, engangement, and organizational photos and I enjoy the artistic side it lets me express, as well as being able to provide others with images they like of themselves.

            <h2>Piano</h2>
            The piano is a hobby I picked up recently, continuing my musical interest from my time in choir and as Band Captain in high school. My goal is to play in every city I visit. As of November 2022, I have played in Houston, San Antonio, and College Station.
